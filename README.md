# LessUtilities
This is basically [CodeUtilities](https://codeutilities.github.io/) but I ported only the features I mainly use to Minecraft 1.18.2:
- /nbs
- /schem
- Side Chat
- Variable Scope View
- LagSlayer HUD
- Item API

## Required mods

- Cloth config API [[Link]](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config)

## Download

https://github.com/KabanFriends/LessUtilities/releases/latest

Or, if you want to build it yourself: Use `gradlew build` to build the mod
